[ ] There's no `main.tf`.  Ideally, someone's Terraform should feel "cohesive" and be immediately navigable.  A `main.tf` is a good way to make that happen -- it signals to the reader that they should basically "start here."

[ ] There's no Remote State.  That's probably intentional in this case, but I literally worked with an architect right before break who couldn't figure out why his Terraform was so wonky and resources were going out of control, and it was because he forgot to commit his Remote State config.

[ ] I noticed you use `NB`.  I also use `NB` in my work and communications whenever I want to call attention to something.  I approve of this immensely.

[ ] I noticed that you have a pattern of `controller_nodes = list(map)`, followed by a `controller_nodes_map = map`.  You could actually make this a single variable instead of two separate ones, but the way you've done it is actually cleaner and greatly preferred -- except when you deal with people who think they're `clever` or `smart`.  Whether this was a conscious decision or not -- good job.

[ ] I'm getting mixed signals/feedback in your disk size vars compared to your memory amount vars.  The disk size vars explicitly state that the values should be specified in GB, which is great!  However, your memory vars don't specify the denomination (MB, GB, etc.).  This can probably be reasonably inferred by reading the default value and/or the resource itself, but having it as part of your variable description would be better so that the end user doesn't need to think about it -- they can just consume.

[ ] Along the same vein as above -- specifying disk size and memory amounts in different denominations is inconsistent (i.e., you need to specify disk size in GB, but memory in MB).  This can make sense, given the differences in magnitude between the two, but usually you're specifying in numbers that are both GB.  This is on the more nit side of feedback, and it's situational, but consider the impacts of consistency where possible.

[ ] I'm going to ignore `var.wk_first_ip`, and most of the subnet-related things in general.  There's a larger design decision to have here if we're talking about production or even shared workloads.  For a local lab, though, it's fine enough.

[ ] `var.cluster_endpoint` and `var.cluster_vip` feel wrong.  They each have notes that they need to be synced with each other.  But in the defaults, they are not synced with each other.  Additionally, you probably want to find a way to get this data dynamically, or you might to only have a `var.cluster_vip`, and then have a `local.cluster_endpoint = "https://${var.cluster_vip}:6443"`.  If you need the port to be dynamic, too, then better to introduced a `var.cluster_endpoint_port`, and then do something like `local.cluster_endpoint = "https://${var.cluster_vip}:${cluster_endpoint_port}"`.

[ ] I see a use of `validation` in a variable -- this is great!

[ ] In a local-only lab, `var.cilium_lb_first_ip` and `var.cilium_lb_last_ip` are fine, but in a production or shared environment (where everyone might be spinning up their own lab in a shared hypervisor infrastructure), you'd want to figure out how to get values like this from a dynamic, centralized DB or IPAM.

[ ] Great job on the `for_each`!  Even if you can't see it now, there's a lot of pain with `count` or a `for_each = set()` when the number of elements is > 1

[ ] You should run all of your codebase through a `terraform fmt -recursive .`, indentation on line 51 in hosts.tf was jarring

[ ] You have two outputs, `talosconfig` and `kubeconfig`.  Local lab, fine, mostly.  Production, shared environments, or situations in which there is a Remote State or your state file could be shared/compromised: verboten.  Terraform does not offer encrypted state files without Terraform Enterprise.  You are leaking credentials.  This is the single actual red flag.

[ ] I don't feel like I can comment too much on the `talos_` resources as I don't have direct experience.  The liberal use of `depends_on` raises an eyebrow, though.  Usually TF is smart enough to not need this, but there are absolutely edge cases where it's not.  `talos_machine_secrets` resource feels...scary to me.  It's probably a requirement, but the naming suggests to me that it might contain sensitive information, which means it's stored in state, and...see above comment about outputs for why this is bad.

[ ] Implement a `terraform-docs` CI job to auto-generate docs.

[ ] Implement a CI job that does the equivalent of `terraform graph -type=plan | dot -Tpng >graph.png` and adds it back to the repo so that the relationship between resources/systems is easy to navigate with limited effort.

[ ] Account for helm cilium install to use the right kubeconfig, or look for alternative auth uses.
